First homework assignment on gitlab by Omri Ronen

Changes made to the original HTML & CSS documents:

I changed the title to a more descriptive one. Instead of 'website' I put the name of the company, 'Horiseon'.

I added header tags into the body to organize all the contents that appear in the header itself.

I added section tags to separate all of the different squares in the webpage that included an image and the paragraph. 

I added alt tags for each image, so a message shows if the pictures fail to laod. 

Lastly I added footer tags to make it clear where the footer is.
